# Plotting-Efficient-Frontier for Dow Jones Index

Linear algebra has various applications in real world. One of them is determining efficient frontier in portfolio diversification.

General theory says that efficient frontier is a set of optimal portfolio which offers highest expected return for a defined risk level or the one that offers lowest risk for a given expected return level.

In the code, optimal matrix is derived by minimizing standard deviation, given some expected return level for the Dow Jones 30 companies. 

The resulted efficient frontier for the Dow 30 is obtained as follows:
